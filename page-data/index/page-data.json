This study proposed a knot–Temporal Pyramid Pooling (TPP) model aimed at monitoring both process incidences and tool wear in the drilling of hybrid stacks, which subsequently informs the machine tool to adjust cutting parameters or, if necessary, replaces the tool. TPP is introduced to remove the restriction of input dimensions, allowing for the acceptance of inputs with arbitrary shapes. On the other hand, a knot structure has been proposed to incorporate the classification of process incidences into the tool wear analysis, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. The proposed model achieves a process incidence identification accuracy of 99.19% and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 10 μm in tool wear prediction, demonstrating robust performance across a wide range of sampling conditions. This achievement facilitates decision-making and optimisation relating to cutting parameters and tool replacement in the context of adaptive drilling of aerospace materials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will make an special page to introduce the principles of our paper.

This paper proposed a deep learning-based approach to accurately identify the crucial process incidence in drilling of hybrid stacks. The influence of three sampling elements: duration, frequency and phase on both signal fidelity and the performance of deep learning is investigated. Based on the property of translation-invariance of convolutional neural network (CNN) and statistical probability, a theory establishing continuous classification equivalent accuracy is proposed and proved through experimentation, which helps strike a balance between immediacy and accuracy in deep learning application. Both minimum sufficient duration (MSD) and frequency (MSF) are found to have a close relation with harmonics driven by machining operation and are determined by spindle rate in the drilling process. Through investigation into phase, the condition and property for minimum sufficient unit are examined. The work establishes the machine signal’s feasibility boundary for deep learning models, supporting a safe, compact, and lossless application of deep learning in industry especially where real-time and low latency is valued.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will make an special page to introduce the principles of our paper.

This paper proposes a novel approach to identify incidences in CFRP/Al stack drilling with 94 % classification accuracy based on signal features and support vector machine (SVM). This enables the application of adaptive drilling which aerospace industry tries to introduce, and cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed) are automatically adjusted based on features extracted from signals obtained to achieve optimal machining. The t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (T-SNE) algorithm is applied to evaluate the separability and invariance of features with the significant influence of tool wear. Collinear analysis and hierarchy dendrogram are conducted to test the accuracy and robustness of the new approach, and a distance-based feature pruning is then proposed to compress data while maintaining the algorithm’s performance. The proposed SVM model achieves an accurate and reliable incidence identification, thereby enhancing the decision-making for adaptive drilling in machining stacked structures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will make an special page to introduce the principles of our paper.
