Although deep learning approaches improve prediction accuracy, they also require significant investment in computational resources. This paper introduces a novel cloud computing framework to enable online and responsive process incident monitoring for composite/Al drilling. By measuring Signal-to-noise ratio of the harmonic components in thrust and torque, a bit depth limit for the signals is established, forming a basis for data minimisation in line with the signal sampling boundary theory. To reduce congestion and delay in the cloud computing system for online tool condition monitoring, a bit depth optimised EBPC cloud computing framework composed of exponential backoff adaptive client traffic control algorithm and priority queue based producer-consumer server request scheduling is proposed in this paper. Local network stress tests confirms the efficiency and resilience of proposed framework, while remote computing experiments demonstrate its capability to operate effectively across all Europe through different connectivities. This framework advances deep learning applications for cloud computing in tool condition monitoring, especially where low-latency response is essential.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will make an special page to introduce the principles of our paper.

This study proposed a knot–Temporal Pyramid Pooling (TPP) model aimed at monitoring both process incidences and tool wear in the drilling of hybrid stacks, which subsequently informs the machine tool to adjust cutting parameters or, if necessary, replaces the tool. TPP is introduced to remove the restriction of input dimensions, allowing for the acceptance of inputs with arbitrary shapes. On the other hand, a knot structure has been proposed to incorporate the classification of process incidences into the tool wear analysis, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. The proposed model achieves a process incidence identification accuracy of 99.19% and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 10 μm in tool wear prediction, demonstrating robust performance across a wide range of sampling conditions. This achievement facilitates decision-making and optimisation relating to cutting parameters and tool replacement in the context of adaptive drilling of aerospace materials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will make an special page to introduce the principles of our paper.

This paper proposed a deep learning-based approach to accurately identify the crucial process incidence in drilling of hybrid stacks. The influence of three sampling elements: duration, frequency and phase on both signal fidelity and the performance of deep learning is investigated. Based on the property of translation-invariance of convolutional neural network (CNN) and statistical probability, a theory establishing continuous classification equivalent accuracy is proposed and proved through experimentation, which helps strike a balance between immediacy and accuracy in deep learning application. Both minimum sufficient duration (MSD) and frequency (MSF) are found to have a close relation with harmonics driven by machining operation and are determined by spindle rate in the drilling process. Through investigation into phase, the condition and property for minimum sufficient unit are examined. The work establishes the machine signal’s feasibility boundary for deep learning models, supporting a safe, compact, and lossless application of deep learning in industry especially where real-time and low latency is valued.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will make an special page to introduce the principles of our paper.
