This work proposed a deep learning approach to identify process incidences from different signals recorded during the drilling of CFRP/Al stacks. The influence of machining signals on the modelâ€™s classification performance is evaluated and investigated. This work contributes to improving the accuracy and reliability with which key incidences during a stack drilling cycle can be recognized in order to adjust cutting parameters during the drilling process to enable adaptive drilling in aerospace stacks.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Our paper gets accepted by CIE 50","date":"2023-07-11"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/update/our-paper-get-accepted-by-cie50/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
