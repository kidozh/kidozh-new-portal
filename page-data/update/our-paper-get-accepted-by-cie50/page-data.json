This work proposed a deep learning approach to identify process incidences from different signals recorded during the drilling of CFRP/Al stacks. The influence of machining signals on the model’s classification performance is evaluated and investigated. This work contributes to improving the accuracy and reliability with which key incidences during a stack drilling cycle can be recognized in order to adjust cutting parameters during the drilling process to enable adaptive drilling in aerospace stacks.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Our paper gets accepted by CIE 50","date":"2023-07-11"}},"locales":{"edges":[{"node":{"ns":"translation","data":"{\"updatePost\":{\"backToUpdates\":\"← Back to updates\",\"dateLabel\":\"Date\",\"titleLabel\":\"Title\"},\"nav\":{\"home\":\"Home\",\"cv\":\"CV\",\"projects\":\"Projects\",\"updates\":\"Updates\",\"contact\":\"Contact\",\"openMenu\":\"Open main menu\"},\"index\":{\"hi\":\"Hi\",\"description\":\"I am Jiduo Zhang and a Ph.D. student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at The University of Manchester.\",\"github\":\"Github\",\"researchgate\":\"ResearchGate\",\"googleScholar\":\"Google Scholar\",\"github_link\":\"https://github.com/kidozh\",\"researchgate_link\":\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jiduo-Zhang\",\"googleScholar_link\":\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nudc3xUAAAAJ&hl=en\",\"latest\":\"Latest\",\"newest\":\"Newest\",\"update\":\"Updates\"},\"update\":{\"title\":\"Updates\"},\"resume\":{\"name\":\"Jiduo Zhang\",\"subtitle\":\"PhD student in The University of Manchester\",\"viewPdf\":\"View in PDF (Full content)\",\"contactDetails\":\"Contact Details\",\"frameworks\":\"Frameworks\",\"researchInterests\":\"Research Interests\",\"skills\":\"Skills\",\"about\":\"About\",\"visitProjectsPrefix\":\"Please visit the\",\"projectsPage\":\"projects page\",\"visitProjectsSuffix\":\"to get detailed information about my projects.\",\"visitPublicationsPrefix\":\"Please visit the\",\"googleScholar\":\"Google Scholar\",\"visitPublicationsSuffix\":\"to view all of my publication.\",\"projects\":\"Projects\",\"selectedPublications\":\"Selected Publications\",\"education\":\"Education\",\"emailLabel\":\"E-mail\",\"locationLabel\":\"Location\",\"locationValue\":\"Manchester, United Kingdom\",\"researchList\":[\"Deep learning\",\"Adaptive drilling\",\"Tool condition monitoring\",\"Machine tool\"],\"skillsList\":[\"HTML\",\"CSS\",\"JavaScript\",\"React\",\"Node.js\",\"Python\",\"C/C++\",\"Dart\",\"Java\",\"Kotlin\"],\"aboutParagraph\":\"Jiduo is currently a PhD student at The University of Manchester (UoM).
