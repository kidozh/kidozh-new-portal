This work proposes a deep learning approach to identify process incidences from signals acquired whilst drilling CFRP/Al stacks, which can achieve both high accuracy and immediate response by a single set of parameters. The influence of both sample length and frequency on the modelâ€™s classification performance is quantified and investigated. This work makes a notable contribution to improving the accuracy and speed of decision making for identifying incidences based on which changes in cutting parameters can be triggered in adaptive drilling of aerospace stacks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We made a special page for this paper to demonstrate its details.
